[h1]About this mod[/h1]
[quote]American RoadSigns is a stripped-down version of hyperdrive_engaged's original [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=418637762]American Roads[/url], which is no longer supported, and unfortunately causes some issues for some players.
The good news is that recently an American Roads texture pack for Roads United was released, with (almost) full Network Extensions, the bad news was that Roads United focuses primarily on the road texturing part. That means that the lovely Americanized road signs that were part of American Roads were no longer present.

And that's how this mod came to be: I stripped the code of American Roads of everything textures-related, and thus American Roads became American RoadSigns.[/quote]


[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[quote]This mod is incompatible with the original American Roads mod.
Other than that I haven't noticed any incompatibilities: if you do, please report them so I can take a look.[/quote]


[h1]Thank you[/h1]
[quote]It can't be stressed enough that full credit goes out to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperdrive_engage/myworkshopfiles/?appid=255710][b]hyperdrive_engage[/b][/url], who unfortunately no longer seems to be creating content for Cities: Skylines. He is the one wrote the source code and created the props - I merely stripped all unnecessary code, optimized a few bits here and there and included some additional debug functionality.[/quote]

[h1]Updates[/h1]
[quote][b][i]July 14th, 2016 - v1.0.2[/i][/b]
Update 1.0.3 added three new options, that enable you to:
- remove manhole covers from highways;
- remove manhole covers from bridges and elevated roads;
- use an alternative highway overhead gantry texture.

[b][i]May 26th, 2016 - v1.0.2[/i][/b]
Update 1.0.2 added a 'render mode' setting for each prop: American, Vanilla or hidden (see 1st screenshot).
Note: the settings will be applied once when loading a city. This means that changes made when in-game will not be applied until you restart the map.

[b][i]May 25th, 2016 - v1.0.1[/i][/b]
Update 1.0.1 re-organized the file structure and added more description data to output_log.txt.
