[h1]About this mod[/h1]
[quote]American RoadSigns is a both stripped-down and enhanced version of hyperdrive_engaged's original [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=418637762]American Roads[/url], which is no longer supported, and unfortunately causes some issues for some players.
The good news is that recently an American Roads texture pack for Roads United was released, with (almost) full Network Extensions, the bad news was that Roads United focuses primarily on the road texturing part. That means that the lovely Americanized road signs that were part of American Roads were no longer present.

And that's how this mod came to be: I stripped the code of American Roads of everything that was road texture-related, and thus American Roads became American RoadSigns. Later, I made the functionality available in-game and added new features such as options to change the visibility of various road-side props such as info terminals, electricity boxes and fire hydrants. This means the name "American Roadsigns" is no longer 100% accurate (the mod does more than its name promises), but I decided to stick with it to avoid confusion.[/quote]


[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[quote]This mod is incompatible with the original American Roads mod.
Other than that I haven't noticed any incompatibilities: if you do, please report them so I can take a look.[/quote]


[h1]Thank you[/h1]
[quote]It can't be stressed enough that full credit goes out to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperdrive_engage/myworkshopfiles/?appid=255710][b]hyperdrive_engage[/b][/url], who unfortunately no longer seems to be creating content for Cities: Skylines. He is the one wrote the source code and created the props - without his pioneer work this mod would never have existed: I merely stripped all unnecessary code, optimized a few bits here and there, added a number of additional features, and included some additional debug functionality.[/quote]

[b][i]February 24th, 2018 - v2.2.0[/i][/b]
- Added support for custom roads introduced by the Mass Transit DLC;
- Changes the core logic to add "prop pack" support (for possible future non-US custom sign support). Because of this change, it is no longer possible to switch between US and vanilla signs once in-game. This now has to be done in the mod options panel [i]before[/i] loading a city. However, it is still possible to toggle visibility of each sign separately in-game.

[b][i]Febuary 18th, 2018 - v2.1.1[/i][/b]
- Fixed an issue that caused incorrect road sign props to be loaded (like "60km/h Speed Limit" signs being replaced with Spence's "45 MPH Exit Speed Limit" sign instead of the included "45 MPH Speed Limit" sign).

[b][i]January 2nd, 2018 - v2.1.0[/i][/b]
- Increased the UI size by 50%;
- Fixed a critical bug that caused an error when loading a city from in-game;
- Fixed a critical bug that caused an error when loading a city after returning to main menu;
- Various minor bug fixed and optimizations.
